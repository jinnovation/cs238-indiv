* On Realism

  - *Realism* = common goal among development teams
  - \uparrow realism \to \uparrow desirability

* Graphics

  - Commonly used to achieve realism
    - *Very* good at this
  - Modern-day graphics hardware \to \downarrow tech barriers

** A Slight Problem

   - Visual realism = "straightforward"
   - *Inherent difficulties* associated with computer graphics
     - Diminishing returns
     - Uncanny Valley
   - Impede increase of realism solely by graphical means
   - *Need*: new, alternative ways to \uparrow realism

** What They Did

   - Unique *path-finding algorithm* for Elizabeth
   - Approximate & model *humanity*
     - Curiosity
     - Autonomy

* The Algorithm: Key Points

  - Leader-follower model
  - Destination-setting
  - Points of Interest (POIs)

** Leader-follower model

   - *Leader* and *Follower*
     - "Mothership"
       - Follower's positioning and movement = relative to =Leader.position=
   - Follower freely set Destination Points within =Leader.maxFollowerRadius=

** Destination Points

   - At any given moment, Follower has a *destination point*
   - Will try to move toward that point
   - Upon reaching, *set new destination point*

** Points of Interest (POIs)

   - *Points of Interest* (*POIs*) in environment
   - Follower may interact with any POI within a certain radius
     - Overrides Leader-Follower radius restrictions
       - Reinstated upon interaction completion
